#### To create a .csv spreadsheet of available streaming TV series:

Run **makeAcornSpreadsheet.sh [-ctu]** or **makeMHzSpreadsheet.sh [-tu]**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
**-c**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
_Canadian_ - Don't delete the text "Not available in Canada." in Acorn TV
descriptions.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**-t**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
_Totals_ - Add column totals and row counts at the end of the spreadsheet.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**-u**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
_Unsorted_ - Leave shows in the order they are found on the web.

Each script creates a number of .csv files. To see the complete list,
look at **saveLatestAcornFiles.sh** or **saveLatestMHzFiles.sh**.

The primary spreadsheet file is called **Acorn_TV_Shows-[DATE].csv**
or **MHz_TV_Shows-[DATE].csv**, where **[DATE]** is todayâ€™s date
in the format yymmdd, e.g. 170610. It can be loaded into Open Office
or Google Sheets for further formatting. Any secondary .csv files
are tucked away in the directories **Acorn-columns** or **MHz-columns**.

Running the script again will overwrite any .csv files from earlier
that day but not from any previous day.

You don't need to keep any .csv files around after loading the
spreadsheet into an application for formatting. Formatted spreadsheets
should get saved as .xls or .ods files. Spreadsheets uploaded to
Google Sheets won't depend on the local file being around.

Rows in the spreadsheet are sorted by title. You can sort them in
the order they are found on the web by using the **-u** switch or
sorting on the first column.

If you want to sort by a different column **_and_** you used the
**-t** switch to add column totals and row counts you should either
create a Named Range to sort on or delete the added rows.  Otherwise
those rows will wind up in the middle of your spreadsheet.

#### To see what has changed since a previous run:

Examine the diff file called **Acorn_diffs-[LONGDATE].txt** or
**MHz_diffs-[LONGDATE].txt**, where **[LONGDATE]** is the date/time
the script was run in the format yymmdd.HHMMSS, e.g. 170609.161113.

If you are happy with the diffs, you can create a new baseline by
running **saveLatestAcornFiles.sh** or **saveLatestMHzFiles.sh**.

If the diff file is large or complex, it could be due to a bug in
the script, or an unforeseen change in the format of the website.

#### To remove any files created by running scripts:

Run **cleanupEverything.sh [-i | -v]**

If you add either -v or -i as an option, it will be passed along
to the rm command.

You will be given a choice whether to delete the primary spreadsheet
files, secondary spreadsheet files, diff results, and diff baselines.
Answer y to delete them, anything else to skip. Deleting them cannot
be undone! To see exacly what will be deleted, look at the script.
