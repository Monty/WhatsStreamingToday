## What's Streaming Today?

**Acorn TV** is a streaming service for British television shows.
**MHz Choice** is a streaming service for European television
detective, mystery, and crime shows.  Both are available in the US
on Apple TV, Amazon Prime, or the web.

Both https://acorn.tv/browse and https://mhzchoice.vhx.tv/series
have a visual interface which lists all their TV series. However,
you have to click on the image for each series to see its description.
I can't find any web page or document that describes all the available
series in one place.

I wrote these scripts to fetch the descriptions and other info from
their websites and create .csv spreadsheet files containing these
columns: (*Titles are hyperlinks to the series on the web*)

+ **Acorn TV:** Title | Seasons | Episodes | Description
+ **MHz Choice:** Title | Seasons | Episodes | Genre | Country
| Language | Rating | Description

I know of no way to incorporate formatting such as column width,
horizontal centering, etc. into a .csv file. I doubt it would be
worth the effort because that's so easy to do with Open Office or
Google Sheets.
