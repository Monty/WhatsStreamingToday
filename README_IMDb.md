### IMDb Spreadsheets

Simplify finding information from IMDb about MHz shows, actors, and the
characters they portray.

**IMDb_Credits-Person.xls** lists primary cast members, show titles, and
characters portrayed for all MHz shows for which we have IMDb information —
sorted by cast member name.

Useful to see all shows a person is in, and what characters they portrayed in
each, *e.g.* Alexandra Rapaport has top billing in both "The Sandhamn Murders"
and "Gåsmamman".

“Person” and “Show Title” are both clickable links to IMDb pages.

**IMDb_Credits-Show.xls** also lists primary cast members, show title, and
characters portrayed, but sorted by show title.

Useful to see who stars in a show, and what character they portrayed.

“Person” and “Show Title” are both clickable links to IMDb pages.  There may be
up to 10 primary cast members for each show title, sorted by IMDb’s billing
rank.

**IMDb_Shows.xls** lists all the MHz shows for which we have IMDb information.

Useful as a short list of what shows are (*and aren't*) included.

The "Primary Title" is what the show is called on MHz. It's also a clickable
link to that show's page on IMDb, since that title may not work as a search term
on IMDb.

"Show Types" that aren't a series complicate matters as each episode has a
separate IMDb page with no parent series - *e.g.* “Bukow and König” and “Murder
In…”.

**Note:** Spreadsheets were generated from downloaded IMDb .gz movie and TV
datasets, *i.e.*

		* name.basics.tsv.gz
		* title.basics.tsv.gz
		* title.principals.tsv.gz
