# Helper for converting Netflix "viewing activity" into hyperlinks
#
# Since there is no way to paste an embedded hyperlink into a text filei,
# paste the link and the title on two consecutive lines, e.g.
#
# https://www.netflix.com/title/80174814
# Borderliner: Season 1: "Millaâ€™s Future"
# https://www.netflix.com/title/80203122
# Luxury Travel Show: Season 1: "Chiang Mai & Eze"
# https://www.netflix.com/title/80217826
# Kavin Jay: Everybody Calm Down!
#
# Paste them in the same order they are in the Netflix "viewing activity" page
